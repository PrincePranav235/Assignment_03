    <p>Use 2 class "ad" and "sd" , "ad" will change the colour to blue, and "sd" will change the backgroundcolour of the elements to red.Now both classes together will change the font style to italic, use them in the  &#60; p &#62; tag;</p>
<h3>Sample para of class ad</h3>
<p class="ad">A crocodile is a hamster's horse. The debonair lemon comes from a dynamic lion! Before snails, prunes were only grapes. A turtle is a chimpanzee's squirrel. We can assume that any instance of a lime can be construed as a witty ant! Some assert that a horse is the cranberry of a scorpion. Framed in a different way, a cow of the kiwi is assumed to be a cultured horse. </p>
<br>
<h3>Sample para of class sd</h3>
<p class="sd">The watermelon is an eagle. Some skillful peaches are thought of simply as elephants. The first enthusiastic pineapple is, in its own way, a lime. The goldfish of a peach becomes an enthusiastic lobster. In recent years, one cannot separate persimmons from charming dolphins. Some posit the warmhearted plum to be less than perfect? However, scorpions are dashing dogs.</p>
<br>
<p>Both class together changed their fonts to italics together.</p>
